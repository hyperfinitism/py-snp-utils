# Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public GitHub Issue**.

Instead, please report it privately via **GitHub Security Advisories**. You can use either of the following:

- **Link**: [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/acompany-develop/py-snp-utils/security/advisories/new)
- **From the GitHub Web UI**:
  - Go to this repository's **Security** tab
  - Click **Report a vulnerability**

When reporting, please include as much detail as possible (e.g., affected versions, impact, reproduction steps, and any suggested fixes or mitigations).
